# **0x00. AirBnB clone - The console**
>In this repository, Sebastian Carvajal and I implemented the AirBnB clone - version1.

## Project's description: 
>This is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

>Steps:
* Create a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of the future instances.
* Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
* Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.
* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Create all unittests to validate all the classes and storage engine.
* Create the command interpreter.
